RIKITAKE
========

Rikitake is a Python command line interface (CLI) software able to:
- Integrate the Rikitake Dynamo differential equation system
- Calculate the gratest lyapunov exponent of the particular solution obtained
- Generate plots with dynamical informations about the system



Introduction: The Rikitake dynamo 
===================
The Rikitake Geodynamo is a model proposed by Tsuneji Rikitake in his paper ["Oscillations of a system of disk dynamos" in 1958](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mathematical-proceedings-of-the-cambridge-philosophical-society/article/oscillations-of-a-system-of-disk-dynamos/CDDB16F7655910A13D299B1325A3239B) in order to describe and quantify Earth's magnetic field oscillation. The model consists in a system of three differential equations of three time dependant functions *x<sub>1<sub/>*, *x<sub>2<sub/>* and *y<sub>1<sub/>* and two parameters *Î¼* and *k*. Exaustive theoretical explaination about Rikitake dynamo can be found in the [supplementary material](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&app=desktop) or in chapter 14 of ["Fractals and Chaos in Geology and Geophysics" by D. L. Turcotte](https://www.cambridge.org/it/academic/subjects/earth-and-environmental-science/solid-earth-geophysics/fractals-and-chaos-geology-and-geophysics-2nd-edition?format=PB). Within this guide, the basic notions about the system, as well as about dynamic systems, will be considered known and will not be explained. 


Getting started: download and installation
====================
You can get Rikitake [here](https://github.com/ManiOrgrim/Rikitake). If you downloaded the .zip file, extract it and you should be able to find the "rikitake" folder in it. 
In order to install and run Rikitake, you need Python v3 ([here](https://www.python.org/)) and pip3 ([here](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)).
From your command line, run the command

~~~
pip3 install -e path/to/rikitake
~~~

where 'path/to/rikitake' should be replaced with the actual path of the rikitake folder in you local computer. When installation is complete, you can run Rikitake from any folder right in your command line, just by running the command:

~~~rikitake~~~

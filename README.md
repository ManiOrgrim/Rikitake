RIKITAKE {#rikitake .unnumbered}
========

Rikitake is a python program that integrates the Rikitake dynamo
differential equation sysytem and calculates the Lyapunov exponents of
the system using the obtained solution.

The Rikitake dynamo {#the-rikitake-dynamo .unnumbered}
===================

The Rikitake dynamo is a model that describes the geodynamo, that is the
mechanism that generate the Earth's megnetic field. The first
description has been made by [Rikitake
(1973)](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/35/1-3/277/615502). These
equations depend on four variables $X_1$, $X_2$, $Y_1$, $Y_2$ and on two
parameters $\mu$ and $k$. More informations can be found in (D. L.
Turcotte, Fractals and chaos in geophysics, 1992, Cambridge University
press). t is a system of four non-linear coupled differential equations
that may show chaotic behaviour. A measure of the chaoticity of a system
is given by the Lyapunov exponents (see, as example, [the relative page
in
Scholarpedia](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Lyapunov_exponent)).

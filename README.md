RIKITAKE
========

Rikitake is a Python command line interface (CLI) software able to:
- Integrate the Rikitake Dynamo differential equation system
- Calculate the gratest lyapunov exponent of the particular solution obtained
- Generate plots with dynamical informations about the system



Introduction: The Rikitake dynamo 
===================
The Rikitake Geodynamo is a model proposed by Tsuneji Rikitake in his paper ["Oscillations of a system of disk dynamos" in 1958](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mathematical-proceedings-of-the-cambridge-philosophical-society/article/oscillations-of-a-system-of-disk-dynamos/CDDB16F7655910A13D299B1325A3239B) in order to describe and quantify Earth's magnetic field oscillation. The model consists in a system of three differential equations of three time dependant functions *x<sub>1<sub/>*, *x<sub>2<sub/>* and *y<sub>1<sub/>*  A description can be found in the [supplementary material](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&app=desktop)
